- Schemas in Python
- Schemas validated in PostgreSQL as well
- Conforms to Macrostrat patterns
  - Data loading in Python
  - Serving data from PostgreSQL with few intermediates


- Schemas are defined in Python but can be stored entirely in PostgreSQL

## Next steps

- Create tabular representations of specific schemas automatically
- Automatically load from tabular representations matching schemas
- `weaver_extracts` schemas
